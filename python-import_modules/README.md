# Python - import & modules

## Description
This project focuses on the modularity of Python. It covers how to import functions and variables from different files, how to handle command-line arguments using the `sys` module, and how to use the `dir()` function to inspect modules. The project also reinforces the importance of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to prevent code execution during imports.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:
* Why Python programming is awesome.
* How to import functions from another file.
* How to use imported functions.
* How to create a module.
* How to use the built-in function `dir()`.
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported.
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs.

## Resources
* [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
* [Command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments)
* [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

## Requirements
* **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
* **Interpretation:** All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.10.*).
* **Style:** Your code must use `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).
* **Executability:** All files must be executable.
* **Format:** All files must end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

## Tasks

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [0-add.py](./0-add.py) | Imports a simple addition function and prints the result. |
| [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py) | Imports multiple math functions and performs basic operations. |
| [2-args.py](./2-args.py) | Prints the number of and the list of its command-line arguments. |
| [3-infinite_add.py](./3-infinite_add.py) | Prints the result of the addition of all arguments. |
| [4-hidden_discovery.py](./4-hidden_discovery.py) | Prints all names defined by a compiled module (excluding `__` names). |
| [5-variable_load.py](./5-variable_load.py) | Imports a variable from another file and prints its value. |
| [100-my_calculator.py](./100-my_calculator.py) | A simple calculator that handles basic operators and error management. |
