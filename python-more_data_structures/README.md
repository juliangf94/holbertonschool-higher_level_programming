# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
This project focuses on the use of more advanced data structures in Python, specifically **Sets** and **Dictionaries**. It also introduces functional programming tools like `map`, `filter`, and `lambda` functions to handle data transformations efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
* Why Python programming is awesome.
* What are sets and how to use them.
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them.
* When to use sets versus lists.
* How to iterate into a set.
* What are dictionaries and how to use them.
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
* What is a key in a dictionary.
* How to iterate over a dictionary.
* What is a lambda function.
* What are the map, filter and reduce functions.

## Tasks

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
* All files interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
* All files should end with a new line.
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
* A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
